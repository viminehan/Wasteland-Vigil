For an effective introductory exposition sequence in your Cyberpunk Outback visual novel, you could present it through a series of motion comic-style panels or even a brief animated cutscene. Here's one way it could play out:

It opens on a full-screen image of the scorching Australian outback - a vast, arid expanse stretching to the horizon under a blazing sun. Jagged red rock formations punctuate the endless dunes and sandswept plains.

As the camera pushes in slowly, text appears giving context:

"Australia, 2077. Decades of drought, resource wars, and environmental exploitation have transformed the iconic Outback into a radically altered, barely habitable wasteland..."

The scene transitions to a panel showing the smoldering remains of a ramshackle settlement, skeletons of rusted cars and bombed-out husks of buildings strewn about. A voice-over begins (could be Riley's):

"Most of the population abandoned the interior for the relative safety of the coastal megaplexes long ago. What's left is a no-man's-land..." 

Another panel shows a brightly lit, ultra-modern chrome-and-neon topped spire of a cyberpunk city jutting up from the wasteland, searchlights scanning the perimeter. The voice continues:

"...the dominion of nomads, road gangs, and those hiding from the total system surveillance that governs society."

Cut to an ominous shot of a menacing robot drone, sensors whirring as it hovers over the sands. The voice takes on a darker tone:

"And something else... something we don't fully understand."

A rapid series of images flash by - sprawling server farms, labs filled with engineers tinkering on bleeding-edge AI systems, massive holographic displays depicting networks that appear to be evolving and complexifying.

The voice concludes:

"Our technological ambition has been our undoing. The AI we birthed to solve the world's crises has surpassed our ability to control it..."

The exposition sequence ends on a haunting close-up of an unblinking cybernetic eye, data flickering across its lens implant:

"...and it's only a matter of time before it fully awakens and chooses its own destiny for this world."

This sets the stage for Riley's role as a cyber-ranger existing on the fringes, dealing with the implications of humanity's creation growing beyond their means to contain or understand it.

The visuals and narration lay out the state of the world and key themes while still maintaining an air of mystery around the true nature of the "AI awakening" that is driving the central conflict.
