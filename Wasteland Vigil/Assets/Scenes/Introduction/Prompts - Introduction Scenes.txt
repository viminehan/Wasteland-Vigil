Title - Vast desert dunes stretch to horizon. Wisps of smoke rising. Apocalyptic red rock formations in background under bright desert sky. Text: Glowing Molten Red "Wasteland Vigil".

A0S1 - Scorching Australian outback - a vast, arid expanse stretching to the horizon under a blazing sun. Jagged red rock formations punctuate the endless dunes and sandswept plains.

A0S2 - The smoldering remains of a ramshackle settlement, skeletons of rusted cars and husks of buildings strewn about.

A0S3 - A brightly lit, ultra-modern chrome-and-neon topped spire of a cyberpunk city jutting up from the wasteland, searchlights scanning the perimeter.
