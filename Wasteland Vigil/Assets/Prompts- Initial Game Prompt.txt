I'm writing a visual novel. The setting is Cyberpunk outback Australian in the year 2077. The theme is: humanity not sure of their place in the world now that AI is getting really powerful. Your job is to outline the plot and any twists, explain a few key characters. The game shouls take 5 - 10 mins to play.
